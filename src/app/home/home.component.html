            When visiting the great outdoors make sure to:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do your research and pack your essentials. Nature is unpredictable, so itâ€™s good to be prepared for anything.</li>
                <li>Make a trip plan and tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back.</li>
                <li>Pack out all garbage, recyclables, and organics. Organic matter can attract wildlife.</li>
            </ul>
