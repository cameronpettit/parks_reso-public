            The BC Parks day use pilot project is back for the 2021 season to help manage visitation levels at five of
            our most popular day use parks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visitors are now required to reserve a day pass to visit participating parks. Depending on the park, a
            day-use pass may not be required for all trails. If the park is open and the trail or trailhead isn’t
            listed, you do not need to reserve a day pass. Check the park webpage at <a
                href="https://bcparks.ca/">www.bcparks.ca</a> for details on where
            you need a day-use pass.

            When visiting the great outdoors make sure to:
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Plan ahead. Download and use the <a href="https://www.adventuresmart.ca/trip-plan-app/">AdventureSmart
                    trip planning app</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do your research and pack the essentials. Nature is unpredictable, so it’s important to be prepared for
                anything.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make a trip plan and tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pack out all garbage, recyclables, and organics. Organic matter can attract wildlife.
            </li>
            <li>
                Always travel within your abilities and prepare for your trip. Follow in-park signage and have your pass
                accessible while in the park and on the trail.
            </li>
        </ul>
